# Plant Image Classification using Deep Learning and MobileNetV2

A deep learning-based plant image classification system built using TensorFlow, Keras, CNNs, and MobileNetV2 transfer learning. The model is trained using image augmentation and fine-tuning to classify plant images with confidence scores.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning can be used for plant image classification.

The model uses **MobileNetV2**, a pre-trained deep learning architecture, as the feature extractor. A custom classification head is added on top of MobileNetV2 to classify plant images into different categories.

The project includes:

- Dataset extraction and preparation
- Image preprocessing
- Data augmentation
- Transfer learning using MobileNetV2
- Model training
- Fine-tuning
- Validation accuracy tracking
- Image prediction with confidence score

## Dataset

The dataset is loaded from a zipped dataset file and extracted inside Google Colab.

The dataset follows a directory-based class structure:

```text
dataset/
├── class_1/
├── class_2/
├── class_3/
└── ...
```

Each folder represents one plant class.

## Training Pipeline

### 1. Dataset Extraction

The dataset is extracted from a ZIP file.

### 2. Image Preprocessing

Images are resized to:

```text
224 x 224
```

and pixel values are normalized.

### 3. Data Augmentation

The following augmentation techniques are applied:

- Rotation
- Zoom
- Horizontal Flip
- Rescaling

### 4. Transfer Learning

MobileNetV2 is loaded with ImageNet weights and used as the base model.

### 5. Initial Training

The base model is frozen, and only the custom classifier layers are trained.

### 6. Fine-Tuning

The base model is unfrozen and trained with a lower learning rate.

### 7. Evaluation

The model is evaluated using validation accuracy.

### 8. Prediction

A test image is passed to the trained model to generate:

- Predicted class
- Confidence score
